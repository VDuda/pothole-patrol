# 🎬 Pothole Patrol - 2 Minute Hackathon Demo

**Goal:** Show how we create an Open Knowledge Graph for infrastructure using 3 key techs: **Edge AI, World ID, and Filecoin.**

---

## 1. The Problem & Solution (0:00 - 0:20)
**Visual:** Landing Page (`/`).

**Speaker:**
"Road data today is expensive and stale. We built **Pothole Patrol**, a DePIN network that turns smartphones into trusted sensors."

"We solve the three biggest problems in crowdsourcing: **Privacy** (using Edge AI), **Fake Data** (using World ID), and **Censorship** (using Filecoin)."

---

## 2. The Edge Dashcam (0:20 - 1:00)
**Visual:** **Mirrored iPhone**. Tap "Settings" -> Show "Rewards Wallet" & "AI Ready". Close.

**Speaker:**
"I'm a driver in Buenos Aires. My phone is running a local AI model via WebAssembly. No video leaves my device."

**Action:** Tap **START PATROL**. Point phone at a video of potholes.

**Speaker:**
"As I drive, the AI detects potholes in real-time. It grabs the GPS coordinates and the image evidence automatically."

---

## 3. Verification & Storage (1:00 - 1:40)
**Visual:** Tap **STOP PATROL**. Tap the **"Potholes"** card to show review list.

**Speaker:**
"This is where we prevent spam. I review my session, delete any mistakes, and then..."

**Action:** Tap **VERIFY & UPLOAD BATCH**. (World ID drawer opens).

**Speaker:**
"I sign the *entire session* with **World ID**. This proves a unique human collected this data. Once verified, the bundle is permanently anchored onto **Filecoin** using Lighthouse."

---

## 4. The Open Data Portal (1:40 - 2:00)
**Visual:** Switch to **Dashboard** (`/portal`). Zoom into Buenos Aires markers.

**Speaker:**
"This updates our global map. Green pins are immutable on Filecoin. Blue pins are World Verified."

**Action:** Click a marker. Show **Image, GPS, and 'Storage: Filecoin' link**.

**Speaker:**
"Researchers and cities can audit every single data point. It's transparent, verified, and open."

---

## 5. The Impact (2:00 - 2:15)
**Visual:** Click **"Export Knowledge Graph"**.

**Speaker:**
"We export this as a standard JSON-LD Knowledge Graph. We're unlocking free, verified infrastructure data for the world."

"This is Pothole Patrol. Built for ETHGlobal."
